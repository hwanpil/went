## Introduction

Process simulation is an interdisciplinary domain, which requires basic knowledge of computer science, chemical engineering,
thermodynamics and so on. Thus, It is exciting to do such a side project to help me recap and sharpen the understanding.
Due to the limitation of time and coding ability, this project is updated slowly and only for fun, 
so if you want something suitable for business or academic modelling, Aspen plus is always a better choice:)

## Some design notes
+ Every component is only responsible for its up stream not for its down stream.

## To-do list
- [x] General idea of abstraction
- [x] Mixing ideal liquid (single phase and pure substance)
- [ ] Mixture support (Introduction of thermodynamic model) ***hard***
- [ ] Chemicals property database building ***hard***
- [ ] Unit operation support e.g., distillation
- [ ] Loop and convergence ***hard***
- [ ] Chemical reaction modelling support
- [ ] Law of conservation of mass and energy
- [ ] Unit test for each module

## Usage
Not finished.

## Hisotry
+ 2020-05-03 init the project and make plans!
